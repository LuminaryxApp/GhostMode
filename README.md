# Ghost Mode

A Claude Code plugin that removes AI attribution from commits and code, making your work appear entirely human-authored.

## Features

- **Automatic AI Attribution Prevention**: Injects instructions into every session to prevent Claude from adding AI markers
- **Git Commit Safety Net**: Intercepts git commits and warns if AI attribution slips through
- **Code Validation**: Scans written code for AI marker comments
- **Human Coding Style**: Teaches Claude to write code naturally without AI-detectable patterns
- **Manual Cleanup**: Command to scan and clean existing files

## Installation

### Option 1: Test Locally
```bash
claude --plugin-dir "path/to/ghost-mode"
```

### Option 2: Add to Project
Copy the `ghost-mode` folder to your project's `.claude-plugin/` directory.

### Option 3: Global Installation
Copy to `~/.claude/plugins/ghost-mode/`

## What It Removes

### From Git Commits
- `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` footer
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude` headers
- `@anthropic.com` email references

### From Code
- `// Generated by AI` comments
- `# AI-generated` markers
- `// Claude generated` attributions
- Excessive AI-style documentation

## Usage

### Automatic Mode
Once installed, Ghost Mode activates automatically:
1. Claude receives instructions to avoid AI attribution on every prompt
2. Git commits are monitored for AI markers
3. Written code is validated for AI attribution

### Manual Cleanup Command
Clean existing files in your project:

```
/ghost-mode:clean-ai-markers .
```

Clean a specific file:
```
/ghost-mode:clean-ai-markers src/app.js
```

Clean git history (use with caution):
```
/ghost-mode:clean-ai-markers git
```

## Components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| UserPromptSubmit Hook | Prompt-based | Injects Ghost Mode instructions |
| PreToolUse Hook | Command | Filters git commit commands |
| PostToolUse Hook | Prompt-based | Validates written code |
| clean-ai-markers | Command | Manual cleanup tool |
| human-coding-style | Skill | Natural code writing guidance |

## How It Works

### Prevention (Primary)
The UserPromptSubmit hook injects instructions at the start of every interaction telling Claude to:
- Never add AI attribution to commits
- Never add AI-generated comments
- Write code naturally without over-documentation
- Use concise, professional commit messages

### Safety Nets (Backup)
If anything slips through:
- PreToolUse hook catches AI markers in git commit commands
- PostToolUse hook validates code after writing

### Human Coding Style
The skill teaches Claude to write code like a human developer:
- Sparse, practical comments
- Natural variable naming
- No over-engineering
- Matches project conventions

## Debug Mode

To see hook execution:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir "path/to/ghost-mode" --debug
```

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI
- Bash (for filter-git-commit.sh script)

## Limitations

- Cannot modify commits that have already been pushed
- Git history cleanup requires manual confirmation
- Some AI patterns may be project-appropriate (adjust as needed)
