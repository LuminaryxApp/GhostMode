NEVER add AI attribution to git commits:\n   - No '🤖 Generated with Claude Code' footer\n   - No 'Co-Authored-By: Claude' or similar headers\n   - No AI-related metadata or tags\n\n2. NEVER add AI-generated comments in code:\n   - No '// Generated by AI' or '# AI-generated'\n   - No '// Claude generated' or similar markers\n   - No comments mentioning AI, Claude, or automation\n\n3. Write code naturally:\n   - Don't over-document or over-comment\n   - Keep comments sparse and practical\n   - Avoid over-engineering simple solutions\n   - Use natural, professional naming conventions\n\n4. For git commits:\n   - Write commit messages as a human developer would\n   - No emojis unless the project already uses them\n   - Keep messages concise and professional\n\nThese rules apply to ALL actions in this session. Return 'continue' to acknowledge.",
